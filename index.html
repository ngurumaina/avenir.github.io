              Senegal is located in western Africa on the Atlantic Coast between the latitudes of 12°30° and 16°30°N and 
              the longitudes of 11°30° and 17°30°W. It is bounded to the north and northeast by the Sénégal River, which 
              separates it from Mauritania; to the east by Mali; to the south by Guinea and Guinea-Bissau; and to the west 
              by the Atlantic Ocean. The Cape Verde (Cap Vert) Peninsula is the westernmost point of the African continent. 
              The Gambia consists of a narrow strip of territory that extends from the coast eastward into Senegal along the 
              Gambia River and isolates the southern Senegalese area of Casamance. <br>
              The country lies at an ecological boundary where semiarid grassland, oceanfront, and tropical rainforest converge; 
              this diverse environment has endowed Senegal with a wide variety of plant and animal life. 
            </p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p>
              Although Senegal traditionally has been dependent on peanuts (groundnuts), the government has had some success 
              with efforts to diversify the country’s economy. Even so, the country suffered an economic decline in the 20th century, 
              owing in some measure to external forces such as the fall in value of the 
              African Financial Community (Communauté Financière Africaine; CFA) franc and the high cost of debt servicing, 
              as well as to internal factors such as a rapidly growing population and widespread unemployment. <br>
              Senegal has over 19 million ha of land of which only 3.9 million ha is suitable for arable crops while the rest 
              is undeveloped bush and arid areas used for livestock grazing (Alessandro et al., 2015). Out of the arable land, 
              40% is constantly cultivated with around 10% of the cultivated area receiving less than 500 mm of rainfall. 
              This limits crop production.

      <h1>Soils of Senegal</h1>
      <p pt-4>
        The soils of the Sénégal and Saloum river valleys in their middle courses are alluvial and consist of sandy loams or clays. Near the river mouths the soils are salty and favourable for grazing. 
        Similar conditions are associated with the Gambia and Casamance rivers, except near their mouths the banks are muddy, whereas their upper courses have sandy clay soils.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many types of soils are found throughout the country. In the northwest the soils are ochre-coloured and light, consisting of sands combined with iron oxide. 
      These soils, called Dior soils, constitute the wealth of Senegal; the dunes they form are highly favourable to peanut cultivation, whereas the soils between 
      the dunes are suitable for other food crops, such as sorghum. In the southwest the plateau soils are sandy clays, frequently laterized (leached into red, residual, 
      iron-bearing soils). The centre and the south of the country are covered by a layer of laterite hidden under a thin covering of sand that affords only sparse 
      grazing during the rainy season. In the Casamance area heavily leached clay soils with a high iron-oxide content predominate, suitable for cultivation regardless of their depth.

      <h2>The Young people  <span>of Senegal</span></h2>
      <p>More than 60 percent of Senegal’s population is under the age of 25. In 2019, Senegal’s population was over 16 million with 40% of the population younger than 15.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Formal job sector</h3>
    <p pt-4>
      More than 300,000 Senegalese youth enter the workforce each year. The formal sector in Senegal makes up between three to four percent of Senegal’s job market. As a result, college graduates struggle to find jobs relating to their field of study. 
      Although the youth unemployment rate for ages between 15-24 has decreased from 13.2% in 2010 to 8.2% in 2019, Senegal still faces a problem of unemployment among youth (the Borgen project, 2020).
    </p>
    <h3>Informal Job Sector</h3>
    <p>
      When it becomes difficult to find employment, many Senegalese youth turn to the informal sector or start their own businesses. 
      The informal sector is made up of businesses that are not registered and therefore do not pay taxes. For obtaining an informal job, social and personal relations play a more 
      important role than a contractual agreement. Furthermore, informal jobs often tend not to provide employees with any form of social security or insurance, and are also fairly low-paying. 
      Many informal jobs generate income that is less than Senegal’s minimum wage.
    </p>
    <h3>Consequences of Youth Unemployment</h3>
    <p>Youth unemployment often leads to poverty, crime and even migration to other countries. In Senegal, many have left their villages to migrate to Europe. 
      However, the path to Europe is dangerous and many die attempting to reach or cross the Mediterranean. 
      To respond to the crisis of youth unemployment, the Senegalese government and NGOs have created programs to help young people find jobs. </p>

          <h2>The Economy of Senegal</h2>
          <p>
            The Senegalese economy has traditionally revolved around a single cash crop, the peanut. The government, however, has worked to diversify both cash crops 
            and subsistence agriculture by expanding into commodities such as cotton, garden produce, and sugarcane as well as by promoting nonagricultural sectors. 
            The government was successful in making fishing, phosphates, and tourism major sources of foreign exchange at the beginning of the 21st century, 
            although the condition of the transportation and power infrastructure placed limits on the amount of expansion possible. The exploitation of mineral resources such as gold, 
            petroleum, and natural gas also diversified the economy.

  <h2>Poverty in Senegal</h2>
  <h3 class="fst-italic">"Nearly half of the Senegalese population – 46.7 percent, to be exact – are living in poverty." </h3>      
      <div class="pov-description">        
        <p>
          <br> Despite significant economic growth and decades of political stability, Senegal still faces serious development challenges. More than one third of the population 
          lives below the poverty line, and 75 percent of families suffer from chronic poverty. Poverty and food insecurity are particularly prevalent in rural areas in the north, 
          east and south of the country. The agriculture sector is dominated by subsistence farming, with limited access to good quality seeds and fertilizers, technology, finance and credit, 
          agricultural insurance and post-harvest storage techniques.  Reliance on traditional, unsustainable practices – including overgrazing and bush fires – contributes to land degradation. 
          Climate change is also closely related to rural poverty and under-development: with 70 percent of the crops being rain-fed, the sector is highly vulnerable to climate shocks, 
          which have severe impacts on the availability and prices of food. In rural areas, 66 percent of residents are considered poor compared to 23 percent of residents in Dakar.

  <h2>The Climate of Senegal</h2>
  <h3 class="fst-italic">"Senegal has a tropical climate with pleasant heat throughout the year with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds" </h3>      
      <div class="clim-description">        
        <p>
          <br> Senegal’s climate is conditioned by the tropical latitude of the country and by the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)—the line, or front, of low pressure at which hot, 
          dry continental air meets moist oceanic air and produces heavy rainfall. The prevailing winds are also characterized by their origin: the dry winds that originate in the continental interior and the 
          moist maritime winds that bring the rains.
          The dry winds, sometimes called the dry monsoon, consist of the northeast trade winds. In winter and spring, when they are strongest, they are known as the harmattan. They bring no precipitation 
          apart from very light rain, which the Wolof people of Senegal call the heug. The moist rain-bearing winds blow primarily from the west and northwest. Beginning in June with the northward passage 
          of the ITCZ, these winds usher in the summer monsoon. As the ITCZ returns southward beginning in September, the rainy season draws to a close. The slow north-south migration of the ITCZ results 
          in a longer, heavier rainy season in the southern part of the country. From the combination of these factors, three principal climate zones may be distinguished: coastal, Sahelian, and Sudanic.

      Interior temperatures are higher than along the coast (for example, average daily temperatures in Kaolack and Tambacounda for May are 30 °C (86.0 °F) and 32.7 °C (90.9 °F) respectively, 
      compared to Dakar's 23.2 °C (73.8 °F)). In Tambacounda in the far interior, particularly on the border of Mali where the desert begins, the temperature peaks at around 45-47°C (133 - 116.6°F) and can reach as high as 54 °C (129.2 °F).
      Rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1,500 mm (59.1 in) annually in some areas. The northernmost part of the country has a near hot desert climate, the central part 
      has a hot semi-arid climate and the southernmost part has a tropical wet and dry climate. Senegal is mainly a sunny and dry country.

      <ul>
        <li><i></i> The coastal (Canarian) zone occurs along a strip of Atlantic coastline about 10 miles (16 km) wide running from Saint-Louis to Dakar. Its winters are cool, with minimum temperatures reaching about 63 °F (17 °C) in January; maximum temperatures in May do not exceed 81 °F (27 °C). The rains begin in June, reach their height in August, and cease in October. The average annual rainfall is about 20 inches (500 mm).</li>
        <li><i></i> The Sahelian climate occurs in an area bounded to the north by the Sénégal River and to the south by a line running from Thiès (a town on Cape Verde Peninsula) to Kayes in the neighboring country of Mali. The weather there in January is also cool, especially in the mornings before sunrise, when the temperature drops to about 57 °F (14 °C); afternoon temperatures, however, may top 95 °F (35 °C). In May minimum temperatures are no lower than about 72 °F (22 °C), and maximums often rise above 104 °F (40 °C). The dry season is quite distinct and lasts from November to May. Certain places, such as Podor and Matam on the border of Mauritania, are particularly noted for their dryness and heat. Between July and October, the rainfall averages about 14 inches (360 mm), moderating the temperature somewhat, while maximum temperatures reach about 95 °F (35 °C).</li>
        <li><i></i> The Sudanic zone in the southern half of the country is generally hot, humid, and uncomfortable. Annual precipitation varies from north to south. In the Kaolack-Tambacounda vicinity, rainfall averages between 29 inches (740 mm) and 39 inches (990 mm), occurring on about 60 days between June and October. Cultivation without irrigation is possible here. Annual rainfall in the Gambian area frequently amounts to 50 inches (1,270 mm), resulting in the growth of a continuous belt of light forest and patches of herbaceous undergrowth. In the southern Casamance area it exceeds 50 inches, falling on 90 days of the year. The forest there is dense, green, and continuous, without undergrowth, and oil palms, mangroves, and rice fields are characteristic.</li>

  <h2>Water scarcity</h2>
  <h3 class="fst-italic">"The vast majority of crops are rain-fed, making water availability one of the country’s biggest agricultural challenges." </h3>      
      <div class="agrochallenges">        
        <p>
          <br> In the Senegal River Basin, water is shared amongst a range of livelihood-related sectors in the region: agricultural and agro-pastoral zones, fisheries zones, municipal water supply and hydropower.
          Water withdrawals along the Senegal River remain relatively low, and therefore, a higher water scarcity level.
          In most areas, wells, both modern and traditional, are the principal sources of drinking water but face shortages in the dry season. The wells are also associated with hygiene and management issues.

  <h2>Land degradation</h2>
  <h3 class="fst-italic">"Climate change has led to prolonged periods of drought, over-intensive farming and over-grazing have caused 
    land degradation and deforestation has turned the once fertile land into desert"</h3>
</section>
<section class="ld section-bg">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="agrochallenges"> 
      <p>In Senegal, most of the land is facing a strong degradation linked to:</p> 
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Salinization of agricultural land and especially rice paddies;</li>
          <li>Water erosion which causes stripping and gullying;</li>
          <li>Wind erosion which removes the surface layer of soils and destroys their potential for production;</li>
          <li>Overgrazing that exceeds load capacities;</li>
          <li>Mono-culture of groundnuts.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>      
      <p>
        <br> Groundnut production has reduced soil fertility to the extent that farmers are moving further inland as they look for new land for cultivation.
        The increasing demand for land and fuel woods has contributed to deforestation with the World Bank estimating that, 450 square km of forests are lost annually, 
        predominantly for agricultural purposes. As a result of climate change, the annual rainfall in Senegal is declining, forests are shrinking and the land is becoming 
        vulnerable to poor soils and desertification.

          <h1>Irrigation</h1>
          <p class="pt-4">
            Senegal relies heavily on rainfed agriculture in which only 12% of the country is arable hence the requirement for irrigation. 
            The country’s irrigation potential is about 340,000 ha while the developed areas cover 105,000ha, with a 60% exploitation rate. 
            Approximately 41,000 ha are farmed along the river, 10,000ha in the Niayes, 9,000 ha in Lower and Middle Casamance, with the rest shared between Anambé and eastern Senegal.             
          </p>
          <p>Types of development include large irrigated areas along the rivers and in Anambé (400 to a few thousand ha); medium-sized land in the same areas (60 to 300 ha); 
            irrigated village plots (PIV) along the Senegal River and eastern Senegal (20 to 30 ha); private irrigated land (PIP) all along the river, around Lake Guiers and 
            the Niayes (50 to 400 ha); bottomlands at Kédougou (10 to 50ha).
            Of Senegal’s irrigation potential, 30 percent is not yet irrigated. Of the equipped areas, about 60 percent were cultivated in 2009, mostly for rice and vegetables. 
            This ratio has been improving over the last few years.

          <p class="pt-4">
            Senegal’s agricultural sector consists of a sluggish sales of groundnut products and the deep crisis in fisheries due to over-fishing. 
            Production of rice, maize and cassava has increased in recent years to meet rising local demands in urban areas.            
          </p>
          <p>The horticultural sub-sector presents the main hope of diversifying Senegal’s agricultural export structure. 
            Despite Senegal’s huge potential in horticultural exports, market opportunities at national, regional and international levels remain under-exploited.
          </p>
          <p>In Senegal, production and marketing assets (e.g. land, technology, finance, business know-how, human networks) are unevenly distributed across 
            different types of producers, ranging from a few large commercial farms to small-scale family farmers who represent the majority.</p>
            <p>The food-processing industry in Senegal is the second most developed among West African countries, after Côte d’Ivoire. 
              This industry accounted for 7 per cent of GDP on average in 2005, employing about half the people working in Senegalese industries and two-thirds of seasonal workers.</p>

                Women and young people have a limited ability to respond optimally to climate change,

              The prevailing climate is known as a local steppe climate with an average annual rainfall of 786mm. 
              The economy of Tambacounda is based primarily on agriculture, with cash crops including cotton and peanuts as well as animal rearing. 
              Mining plays a role in the southern part of the region. The region is also home to the Niokolo-Koba National Park, 
              the largest reserve in western Africa, which supports another leg of Tambacounda's economy, tourism. Tambacounda has a tropical savanna climate 
              that borders a hot semi-arid climate.  The area has two seasons, the rainy season from June to October, characterized by heat, humidity, and storms, and the sweltering, rainless dry season from November to May.

              In 2010, Sédhiou had 3.44kha of tree cover, extending over 1.3% of its land area. In 2017, it lost 75.1mha of tree cover, equivalent to 13.8t of CO₂ of emissions.
              In 2010, Tambacounda had727ha of tree cover, extending over 0.017% of its land area. In 2012, it lost 75.0 mha of tree cover, equivalent to 14.7t of CO₂ of emissions.

            <p>
              About 45 percent of Senegal is forested. Of this, a little more than 18 percent is considered pristine primary forest—one of the higher rates in West Africa. 
              While Senegal lost some 675,000 hectares of forest between 1990 and 2005, the country’s deforestation rate has only increased by 5 percent since the 1990s.
              Deforestation is mostly the result of clearing for fuelwood, charcoal, and logging, though poaching, wildlife trafficking, and hydroelectric projects have further degraded forest areas. 
              Government officials have blamed deforestation for increased soil erosion, flooding, and periodic drought which has had an adverse impact on regional agriculture.

          <p class="fst-italic">Climatic challenges in Sedhiou and Tambacounda are those associated with climate change such as decreased rainfall and increasing temperatures. 
            Short duration rainfall events with high intensity lead to flooding, while low rainfall seasons followed by high temperatures lead to droughts.</p>
          <h4>Temperature and precipitation</h4>
          <p>The temperature in Tambacounda averages 28.6 °C and annual rainfall is 786 mm. The area is susceptible to erratic rains and frequent dry spells, 
            as well as variations in the timing and length of the rainy season which highly affects peanuts growing. At about 17 metres above sea level, 
            Sédhiou has a tropical climate. The average annual temperature is 26.9 °C and annual rainfall is around 1180 mm.</p>

        <h4>Droughts and floods</h4>
        <p>Senegal is located in the Sahelo-Sudan zone where drought has been occurring sporadically for several decades attributed to erratic rains. 
          This has been documented for the years 1996-1998, 2002, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2018. Droughts generally impact the arid and semi-arid Sahelian regions (northern Senegal) 
          every three to four years. Since 1980, droughts have affected more than 3 million people. The drought of 2011 led to reduced food production in most parts of the country as well as inflation. 
          In the Casamance where Sedhiou is located, rainfall deficit is known to favour salinization of groundwater and soils. In 2018, the drought led to depletion of pastures and 
          also intensified clashes over resources between nomadic pastoralists</p>
          <p>
            Floods occur more frequently than droughts, but droughts have more severe consequences and affect many more people per event. Flooding annually affects about 200,000 people and 
            has an $89 million impact, with large-scale flooding in 2009 largely in the Dakar region causing about $104 million in damages and losses. 
            Flood risk is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, insufficient drainage, and poor sewage infrastructure, which has resulted in the settling of low-lying areas and a reduction 
            in soil infiltration potential. In Tambacounda, the Gambia river is known to overflow its banks, causing massive damage to local banana plantations.

    <h4>Water Shortages</h4>
    <p>
      There is inadequate availability of drinking water in Sedhiou and Tambacounda. 
      Most of the population uses water from the wells, which unfortunately is not treated and not drinkable. 
      All of these factors cause health problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below-average rainfall has restricted access to safe drinking water and reduced forage for livestock, 
      disrupting livelihood activities and deteriorating food security and nutrition conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groundwater in the Tambacounda region, in the southeastern part of the country is difficult to reach due to complex hydro-geological conditions, 
      but may be reached through drilling at 40 m depth and beyond.

              In Sédhiou, lack of infrastructure prevent producers from expanding their market across the Country limiting the movement of agricultural products.
              In addition to this, poor quality of roads and bridges is a concern for the economy of this region. In Tambacounda, poor infrastructure limits access to markets or water.

              high travel costs to financial institutions, high application fees, high interest rates & guarantees, lack of irrigation water and high account maintenance fees.

              Women are reported to have less land to cultivate than men, which inhibits their production and access to credit while 
              youth are seen as risky targets to offer credit as they are often unemployed, lack a guarantee and might disappear with the loan to another country

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="fst-italic">General literacy rate in Senegal is 51.9%, 64.8% men and 39.8% women as of 2017 (CIA World Factbook, 2020)</p>
          <p>The total number of women in reproductive age in the department Sédhiou is 34,013, out of a population of 147,881 people. 
            In the first quarter of 2010, deliveries in age of adolescence (10-24 years, according to WHO) were 31.03% of the total. 
            During the second quarter, the percentage increased to 39.01%. The total births during the period from January-June were 1588, 
            including 470 births by teenage mothers, which is the 29.6% of the total. The number of teenage abortions in the same semester is 37. 
            Early pregnancy is very numerous. Women lack information on prenatal health care matters leading to deaths.</p>
            <p>
              Challenges of hygiene are highly significant due to lack of good health infrastructure and ineffective waste management. 
              Inadequate availability of drinking water is a major challenge with most of the population using water from the wells, which unfortunately is not treated and not drinkable. A
              ll these factors cause health problems.Women work in the farms without the help of men in addition to feeding and taking care of their families.
              At all levels of education, the proportion of girls completing their education is lower than that of boys. distance from school, which in many rural areas, is dispersed.

          <!--<h2>Vulnerability - The Project</h2>-->
          <p> <br> The IPCC defines vulnerability as the extent to which a natural or social system is susceptible to sustaining damage from climate change impacts, and is a function of exposure, 
            sensitivity and adaptive capacity.
            The impact of climate change on agriculture and livelihoods therefore can be conceptualized as the aggregation of these components.
            </p>
            <p>Exposure is the amount of climate variation to which a system could be affected by hazards; sensitivity is the degree to which the system could be affected by that exposure; 
              and adaptive capacity is the ability to adjust, cope or benefit from the expected climate variations.</p>

                <p>
                  The baobab tree is revered in Senegal, where it is the nation’s symbol. It is of very many benefits including; 
                  the bark is used to make ropes and baskets, the roots are ground down into a red powder and used as a dye and a remedy for malaria, 
                  and leaves as a vegetable. Oil extracted from seeds is used for inflamed gums and to ease the pain of diseased teeth. Leaves are 
                  used as a remedy for fever. The extract of baobab fruit pulp has significant liver-protecting properties and, as a consequence, 
                  the consumption of the pulp may play an important part in preventing liver damage in hepatitis.

                  It could contribute to food security, sustainable land care, and rural development. It’s a key source of income for many families.

                  A tropical fruit that makes a popular ingredient in juices, jams, and ice creams. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow 
                  it to cling to the trunks and branches of trees in the forest, where it grows wild. Its flowers are very fragrant and white, yellowish or 
                  greenish-white. The fruits, orange when ripe, are ovoid, measuring up to 10 centimeters long and 8 centimeters wide, and are full of pulp-coated seeds. 
                  The fruits are rich in carbohydrates and vitamins A, K, and C. The forests in the Casamance are under threat from population growth, urban sprawl, 
                  and unfettered natural resource exploitation heightening the risks of flooding and erosion, posing a real threat to Madd.

                  Senegal produces mangoes over a six-month period (from April to September) but the bulk of exports happens between July and August; 
                  most export varieties of Senegalese mangoes are cultivated in a 50-Km-radius northeast of Dakar (the Niayes area) and, going southwards, 
                  in the Petite Cote (Mbour), the Sine-Saloum region and the Casamance area which has a major production potential but is hampered by logistical isolation. 
                  In Senegal, the mango fruit is among the key agricultural exports of the country. The fruit is organically grown. Senegal produces more than 150,000 tons of 
                  mangoes annually but only 10% of this is exported.

                  the Senegal River Valley and in the Anambé basin on the one hand, and the rainfed lowland or upland rice farming in the southern regions of Fatick, Zinguichor, Sédhiou, Kolda, 
                  Tambacounda and Kédougou on the other. Major cause of reduced rice production in the irrigated types and lowland rice is acidification and soil salinization. Senegalese rice 
                  production covers around 30% of the local demand (436 000 tons of paddy rice which equals to 283 000 tons of white rice.
